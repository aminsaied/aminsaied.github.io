**Abstract.** In this talk we'll review the ðŸ¤—Hugging Face Transformers
library. This is an open-source library with the stated goal to "democratize
NLP". We'll briefly review some background, explain what problems Huggingface
is trying to address, and cover some of the tools and techniques they provide.
We will not assume any familiarity with transformers.
